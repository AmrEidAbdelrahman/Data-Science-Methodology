> The CRISP-DM methodology is a process aimed at increasing the use of data mining over a wide variety of business applications and industries.

 **Business Understanding** This stage is the most important because this is where the intention of the project is outlined. Foundational Methodology and CRISP-DM are aligned here.

They donâ€™t all see the same things or in the same manner. Without clear, concise, and complete perspective of what the project goals are resources will be needlessly expended.
