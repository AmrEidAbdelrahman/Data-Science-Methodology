# # Recap <a id="0"></a>
# 
# In Lab **From Understanding to Preparation**, we explored the data and prepared it for modeling.

# The data was compiled by a researcher named Yong-Yeol Ahn, who scraped tens of thousands of food recipes (cuisines and ingredients) from three different websites, namely:

# <strong> Important note:</strong> Please note that you are not expected to know how to program in Python. This lab is meant to illustrate the stages of modeling and evaluation of the data science methodology, so it is totally fine if you do not understand the individual lines of code. We have a full course on programming in Python, <a href="http://cocl.us/PY0101EN_DS0103EN_LAB4_PYTHON_Coursera"><strong>Python for Data Science</strong></a>, which is also offered on Coursera. So make sure to complete the Python course if you are interested in learning how to program in Python.

# ## [bamboo_tree] Only Asian and Indian Cuisines
# 
# Here, we are creating a decision tree for the recipes for just some of the Asian (Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Thai) and Indian cuisines. The reason for this is because the decision tree does not run well when the data is biased towards one cuisine, in this case American cuisines. One option is to exclude the American cuisines from our analysis or just build decision trees for different subsets of the data. Let's go with the latter solution.

# Let's build our decision tree using the data pertaining to the Asian and Indian cuisines and name our decision tree *bamboo_tree*.

# In[6]:


# select subset of cuisines
asian_indian_recipes = recipes[recipes.cuisine.isin(["korean", "japanese", "chinese", "thai", "indian"])]
cuisines = asian_indian_recipes["cuisine"]
ingredients = asian_indian_recipes.iloc[:,1:]

bamboo_tree = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3)
bamboo_tree.fit(ingredients, cuisines)

print("Decision tree model saved to bamboo_tree!")


# Let's plot the decision tree and examine how it looks like.

# In[7]:


export_graphviz(bamboo_tree,
                feature_names=list(ingredients.columns.values),
                out_file="bamboo_tree.dot",
                class_names=np.unique(cuisines),
                filled=True,
                node_ids=True,
                special_characters=True,
                impurity=False,
                label="all",

with open("bamboo_tree.dot") as bamboo_tree_image:
    bamboo_tree_graph = bamboo_tree_image.read()
graphviz.Source(bamboo_tree_graph)


# The decision tree learned:
# * If a recipe contains *cumin* and *fish* and **no** *yoghurt*, then it is most likely a **Thai** recipe.
# * If a recipe contains *cumin* but **no** *fish* and **no** *soy_sauce*, then it is most likely an **Indian** recipe.

# You can analyze the remaining branches of the tree to come up with similar rules for determining the cuisine of different recipes. 

# Feel free to select another subset of cuisines and build a decision tree of their recipes. You can select some European cuisines and build a decision tree to explore the ingredients that differentiate them.

# # Model Evaluation <a id="4"></a>

# <img src="https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/prc3kksci2a6deks36jpyf4cf4oxh74a.png" width=500>

# To evaluate our model of Asian and Indian cuisines, we will split our dataset into a training set and a test set. We will build the decision tree using the training set. Then, we will test the model on the test set and compare the cuisines that the model predicts to the actual cuisines. 

# Let's first create a new dataframe using only the data pertaining to the Asian and the Indian cuisines, and let's call the new dataframe **bamboo**.

# In[9]:


bamboo = recipes[recipes.cuisine.isin(["korean", "japanese", "chinese", "thai", "indian"])]


# Let's see how many recipes exist for each cuisine.

# In[10]:


bamboo["cuisine"].value_counts()


# Let's remove 30 recipes from each cuisine to use as the test set, and let's name this test set **bamboo_test**.

# In[11]:


# set sample size
sample_n = 30


# Create a dataframe containing 30 recipes from each cuisine, selected randomly.

# In[12]:


# take 30 recipes from each cuisine
random.seed(1234) # set random seed
bamboo_test = bamboo.groupby("cuisine", group_keys=False).apply(lambda x: x.sample(sample_n))

bamboo_test_ingredients = bamboo_test.iloc[:,1:] # ingredients
bamboo_test_cuisines = bamboo_test["cuisine"] # corresponding cuisines or labels


# Check that there are 30 recipes for each cuisine.

# In[13]:


# check that we have 30 recipes from each cuisine
bamboo_test["cuisine"].value_counts()


# Next, let's create the training set by removing the test set from the **bamboo** dataset, and let's call the training set **bamboo_train**.

# In[14]:


bamboo_test_index = bamboo.index.isin(bamboo_test.index)
bamboo_train = bamboo[~bamboo_test_index]

bamboo_train_ingredients = bamboo_train.iloc[:,1:] # ingredients
bamboo_train_cuisines = bamboo_train["cuisine"] # corresponding cuisines or labels


# Check that there are 30 _fewer_ recipes now for each cuisine.

# In[15]:


bamboo_train["cuisine"].value_counts()


# Let's build the decision tree using the training set, **bamboo_train**, and name the generated tree **bamboo_train_tree** for prediction.

# In[16]:


bamboo_train_tree = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=15)
bamboo_train_tree.fit(bamboo_train_ingredients, bamboo_train_cuisines)

print("Decision tree model saved to bamboo_train_tree!")


# Let's plot the decision tree and explore it.

# In[17]:


export_graphviz(bamboo_train_tree,
                feature_names=list(bamboo_train_ingredients.columns.values),
                out_file="bamboo_train_tree.dot",
                class_names=np.unique(bamboo_train_cuisines),
                filled=True,

with open("bamboo_train_tree.dot") as bamboo_train_tree_image:
    bamboo_train_tree_graph = bamboo_train_tree_image.read()
graphviz.Source(bamboo_train_tree_graph)


# Now that we defined our tree to be deeper, more decision nodes are generated.

# #### Now let's test our model on the test data.

# In[18]:


bamboo_pred_cuisines = bamboo_train_tree.predict(bamboo_test_ingredients)


# To quantify how well the decision tree is able to determine the cuisine of each recipe correctly, we will create a confusion matrix which presents a nice summary on how many recipes from each cuisine are correctly classified. It also sheds some light on what cuisines are being confused with what other cuisines.

# So let's go ahead and create the confusion matrix for how well the decision tree is able to correctly classify the recipes in **bamboo_test**.

# In[19]:


test_cuisines = np.unique(bamboo_test_cuisines)
bamboo_confusion_matrix = confusion_matrix(bamboo_test_cuisines, bamboo_pred_cuisines, test_cuisines)
title = 'Bamboo Confusion Matrix'
cmap = plt.cm.Blues

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
bamboo_confusion_matrix = (
    bamboo_confusion_matrix.astype('float') / bamboo_confusion_matrix.sum(axis=1)[:, np.newaxis]
    ) * 100

plt.imshow(bamboo_confusion_matrix, interpolation='nearest', cmap=cmap)
plt.title(title)
plt.colorbar()
tick_marks = np.arange(len(test_cuisines))
plt.xticks(tick_marks, test_cuisines)
plt.yticks(tick_marks, test_cuisines)

fmt = '.2f'
thresh = bamboo_confusion_matrix.max() / 2.
for i, j in itertools.product(range(bamboo_confusion_matrix.shape[0]), range(bamboo_confusion_matrix.shape[1])):
    plt.text(j, i, format(bamboo_confusion_matrix[i, j], fmt),
             horizontalalignment="center",
             color="white" if bamboo_confusion_matrix[i, j] > thresh else "black")

plt.tight_layout()
plt.ylabel('True label')
plt.xlabel('Predicted label')

plt.show()


# After running the above code, you should get a confusion matrix similar to the following:

# <img src="https://ibm.box.com/shared/static/69f5m7txv2u6g47867qe0eypnfylrj4w.png" width=500>

# The rows represent the actual cuisines from the dataset and the columns represent the predicted ones. Each row should sum to 100%. According to this confusion matrix, we make the following observations:
# 
# * Using the first row in the confusion matrix, 60% of the **Chinese** recipes in **bamboo_test** were correctly classified by our decision tree whereas 37% of the **Chinese** recipes were misclassified as **Korean** and 3% were misclassified as **Indian**.
# 
# * Using the Indian row, 77% of the **Indian** recipes in **bamboo_test** were correctly classified by our decision tree and 3% of the **Indian** recipes were misclassified as **Chinese** and 13% were misclassified as **Korean** and 7% were misclassified as **Thai**.

# **Please note** that because decision trees are created using random sampling of the datapoints in the training set, then you may not get the same results every time you create the decision tree even using the same training set. The performance should still be comparable though! So don't worry if you get slightly different numbers in your confusion matrix than the ones shown above.
